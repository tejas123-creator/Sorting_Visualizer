<h2>About</h2>

The goal of this project was to provide a learning tool for beginning computer science students. Users can step forwards or backwards through each sorting algorithm, watch the algorithms play out fast or slow, and even submit their own set of values to be sorted.

<h2>How it works</h2>

When the user selects a sorting algorithm, the visualizer runs the selected sorting algorithm on the given array. Each "step" in the algorithm is recorded, with all associated color coding (this is feasible since this visualizer works with small array sizes). Since every "step" has been recorded, running the animation and stepping forward and backwards through the animation is simply a matter of choosing which step to display.
